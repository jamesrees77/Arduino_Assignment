 Building a sign language glove using an Arduino.

As part of our IoT Assignment myself and Lana have designed and built a sign language glove using an Arduino. 

We have used five flex sensors along with a series of wires and resistors. When the user moves or bends their hand in certain ways (following sign language rules) the data is displayed on the screen on an app we have built.  

At this current stage we have managed to get the glove to recorgnise a few letters from the alphabet. We did this by logging the resitance and setting it to a variable called bend. We then had a series of statements that would change the letter based on these specific bends.
